      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Avanish's SmartShop Idea</a>
      <p>As a teenager who dislikes shopping the idea of Smartshop seems appealing. The ability to find clothes that both fit me and are in style is hard and automating this process seems like an appealing concept to me. The shortcomings of this product are the competition from online shopping services such as Amazon and Google that already do a similar process. These companies are acknowledged in the plan, but the amount of data that these companies already have makes it hard to match their level of accuracy when providing recommendations. The team has a clear plan but the prevalence of a system similar to theirs is why I rejected this idea.  </p>
      
 <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ryan-hallock/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Ryan's Bus Tracking System</a>
      <p>Ryan is addressing a recurring issue of buses being late or not showing up. Last year I was dependent on the Zeroth period bus to transport me to the high school; however, it was constantly late or an administrator had to call a new bus to transport us. The problem Ryan is tackling is one I have wanted to for many years, but I don&#39t believe his solution is a clear solution to this problem. Giving the administrators a map showing which buses are on time or late may bring comfort to parents; however, if a bus is running late there is little an administrator can do besides calling another bus. Ryan has a clear understanding of his project and would be successful in creating it, but for me, it doesn&#39t address the problem he is solving which is why I am rejecting his idea.</p>

      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Cayson's Unity Project</a>
      <p> Cayson has an idea about creating a new Unity based game, which seems compelling, but for me it contains numerous concerns. The first of which is the lack of clarity in his business plan about what the game is and how it is going to be advertised. The business plan only suggests the idea of a game and target demographic without having a key gernera of the game or what type of game it is. The lack of purpose is a major deterant for me since I will not have a clear idea of the project that I will be pursuing. There would also be steep competition between this game and other Unity based games. These are the reasons why I rejected the idea of Cayson&#39s Unity game although with a bit more detail I could see myself joing this project. </p>

      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/faraz-piracha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Faraz's Foob Idea</a>
      <p>The Foob idea has a clear plan and timeline. They seek to tackle the issue of what someone can cook with a simple application designed to take what a person has in their house and provide suggestions on what they can cook. My issues with this application come with the steep competition and a lack of clarity on the roles of additional team members. There is already an abundance of pamphlets and websites that accomplish this goal and this application doesn&#39t add anything significant to differentiate itself. The other issue of no additional roles comes in the Team and Key Roles section. They currently have three roles that are already filled leaving me questioning what my role would be on this project. These are the main reasons why I rejected this project alongside my dislike of cooking. </p>

      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Evan's Extracurricular App</a>
      <p>The goal to congregate all of the social media notifications from clubs into one area has some promise. I really like the idea of giving engagement points to students who participate in the form because it could drive up engagement for many clubs. The main issues I see with this idea are the lack of a clear timeline and the steep competition. The idea looks completable but lacks a clear timeline or roles. Roles and the timeline can help streamline the process and if it were included I might have accepted this proposal. The other issue is the misjudgment of what competition Evan is facing. Many clubs already have Remind and Band which present a free way for clubs and students to communicate events; Evan&#39s idea would be strictly a more expensive version of these applications which is why I am rejecting his proposal.

       <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Onik's ShelterSafe</a>
      <p>Onik goes into great detail about his application to serve information about shelters to people in danger of a natural disaster. I really like the idea of an application that could help save lives and serve a rising issue such as climate change. I also like the clear Gnatt chart and verbose explanation of each aspect of his idea. The reason I unfortunately decided to decline the idea was because personally I feel the idea to be rather ambitious. With only a small team to gather an extensive amount of data it would be hard to provide the necessary information to each customer. Also the app would need to first garner a large audience before any relief organization would find it advantageous to invest in it. Overall Onik&#39s plan is one of the most well thought out I have seen, but the overly ambitious goals and reach are what eventually caused me to reject his proposal.

       <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-turner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">William Team's Etch</a>
      <p> The idea of Etch seems compelling hypothetically but the website that William created fails to address many of the crucial issues of this product. His initial problem statement is quite unclear to me and the solution makes no sense without this context. Although a board that lights up with controls on an app would be a neat introduction to programming for children at a young age, the competition of spheres and other robotics-based ideas is hard to compete with. The idea will be hard to sell with such stiff competition and a lack of marketing ideas. William has clearly defined for teams to work on the project, but does not include a Gantt chart or clear milestones leaving a lot of ambiguity in the timeline for this project, which is why I ultimately had to reject the idea.

 <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Tejasvi Team's Symptom Quiz</a>
      <p>The symptom quiz seems like a useful idea with a lot of practicality. People get sick all the time, like I am now, and having a hassle-free quiz that could diagnose someone who in theory is a practical idea for many people. However, from personal experience, I have seen the same symptoms for multiple sicknesses, and putting all of the judgment on an application is a risky maneuver because it leaves the app liable if the diagnosis is wrong. Along with this, the high prices for what seems like a cheap product to create competition of WebMD makes it a hard product to be used en mass. The intent of the idea and planning seem adequate but the competition and personally finding it impractical force me to reject the idea.   </p>
      

 <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Muqadam Team's Spaceward</a>
      <p>The Spaceward idea seems to come and address a common issue with school-based applications; however, the Skyward application is not one of the applications that faces this issue. Although I can not access Skyward currently, when I could, I found the application easy to navigate and provide the information I need to access in a clear user-friendly interface. The competition with Skyward, which already holds a large amount of market share, will stunt the growth of the application. The absence of a Gnatt chart also worries me because the plan is without a clear timeline despite the positions being clearly throughout. My opinion of this product not being needed is the main reason why I rejected this application.  </p>
      

 <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Brett Team's School Food</a>
      <p>The idea a liked the best out of all the astounding ideas was Brett Team&#39s SchoolFood. The idea affects many of my friends, for example Hamza, who have a class far from the cafeteria and I think it is an achievable goal for programmers of our level. The team has come up with a well throughout plan with key roles and objectives. The overall concept and idea are the ones that stick out to me the most and could easily be implemented in our campus and possible other large campus in our area. The few expenses and ability to generate revenue are another reason why I believe in the sustainability in the project. These are the reasons why I have chosen this project as my ISP for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>PS: I saw other projects that were very similar to the one I chose and those would be my next choses. I didn&#39t reject them due to the amazing amount of similarities between them and the one I chose. </p>
