    <h2>Identity:</h2>
	<p>The Physics Prep App is an application that helps students prepare for physics tests and AP exams throughout the year similar to Merlin Mavens which would be specific to Allen or another district.</p>
<h2>Problem:</h2>
	<p>Physics is a hard subject to grasp and has one of the highest AP exams fail rates for AP Physics 1. Physics also is generally a subject that parents have little to no experience in, forcing students to look for other avenues for supplementing their learning.</p>
 <h2>Solution:</h2>
	<p>My solution is an app that students can download. My solution helps students obtain personalized studying with questions specific to the district using it. It will also contain teacher-approved questions instead of the student relying on a third-party website. Although third-party websites could be helpful they provide questions that don't help the student with an issue or a human to help work with the student.</p>
<h2>Target Market:</h2>
	<p>My target market is districts with students struggling in AP physics exams or needing supplemental help with physics. I also intend to make the app appealing to students who are willing to learn.</p>
<h2>Potential Competition:</h2>
    <p>The competition would be individual websites or apps that offer a similar service to online tutors. The reason we would be unique however is that my app is just a framework where a district can add their specific information for their test and add their own tutors. The app will also come with an initial set of AP preparation questions for the district to use at its own discretion.</p>
<h2>Revenue Streams:</h2>
	<p>Physics would receive revenue from districts paying a monthly or yearly bill for the app's services. We can also charge students with additional preparation material or tests not covered by the district.</p>
 <h2>Marketing Activities:</h2>
    <p>My marketing activities would be presenting the original idea to our district by showing a prototype to teachers. Expanding outside of Allen would be done with a YouTube video promoting our product and initially emailing neighboring districts or schools if they are interested.

<h2>Expenses:</h2>
    <li> Publishing the App on the Apple store, Google Play store, and other platforms. </li>
    <li> Mantinence of the app (debugging, updates, etc.) </li>
      
<h2>Team/ Key Roles:</h2>

    <li> Lead Developer - Rupak </li>
    <li> Head of Marketing - TBD </li>
    <li> Application Management - TBD </li>
    <li> Question getter - TBD </li>
