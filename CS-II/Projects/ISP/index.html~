    <h2>Brief Summary of Our ISP</h2>
	<p>Our business, SchoolFood, provides an application for schools in order to allow online ordering for students. This would be an application that students can use to order their food while not forcing them to wait in line for long periods of time. The staff would then be able to address the orders through the application and hopefully speed up the process of ordering food at the cafeteria. The application would also allow students to be productive while they wait for their food since they no longer have to wait in line. These are our goals we hope to achieve with SchoolFood.</p>
