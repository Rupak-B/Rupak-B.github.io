	  <p>Bias is a detrimental part of any project. Seeing where bias may come from and how it affects a project can help a project overcome some of these challenges. Some decision biases one may encounter in a large project are desire biases, habit biases, complexity biases, bandwagon biases, and availability biases (Arnott, 1998; Gordon, 2022).</p>
	  
	  <p>The desire bias is based on large goals and perfection. If one’s group has lofty ambitions with people who desire perfection one might be susceptible to a desire bias. The desire bias could blind one’s teams to only focus on the end goal (Arnott, 1998). To mitigate the effects of this bias, one must be okay with products that do not meet one’s standards. Although the idea might not be perfect, one must move on in order to complete one’s project. To avoid this bias one must maintain a clear picture of the ultimate goal and try to remain calm under time pressure. Another idea is to avoid constant editing of a single component of one’s project. Setting boundaries for when a task is completed can help minimize the time we spend on a single component of the project.  </p>
	  <p> The tendency to use previously mastered techniques is common in many fields including computer science and is known as the habit bias. One may resort to using familiar techniques when working on large projects even if they are suboptimal. This may be due to the belief that what we did in the past is the best without exploring alternatives (Arnott, 1998). One would be susceptible to this if one is comfortable with what they have done in past projects, such as other independent projects. This can lead to sections of a project not being compatible with other sections. One can overcome this by researching other techniques to achieve certain goals. One may also ask fellow students for assistance when working on a complex part of the project.</p>
	  <p> Complexity bias is "time pressure, information overload and other environmental factors which can increase the perceived complexity of a task" (Arnott, 1998). Complexity bias can come in many different forms and will definitely have an impact on any independent study project. When one's idea has a strict timeline and large amounts of items to complete, one might try to find alternate methods of completing the task. Another way one can avoid this bias is by taking a slow approach to concepts or asking other computer science community members for assistance when one reaches a perceived problem. The complexity bias is a bias that everyone must endure in order to prevent procrastination or giving up in one’s project. </p>
	  <p>The availability bias is where one focuses on the immediate problem at hand while not focusing on the planned problem or furthering one's research (Gordon, 2022). This problem is most prevalent when trying to finish a project right before the deadline because one might be tunnel visioned on the immediate deadline instead of the greater project. One can prevent this issue by researching prior to starting the project or pacing one’s self in order to have ample time to complete the necessary tasks. </p>
	  <p>The bandwagon bias is where The bandwagon bias is common in the computer science industry since one of the most commonly visited websites is StackOverflow. People who use these websites will often believe the first threat they read on these websites since the solution worked for someone else (Gordom, 2022). The main issue with this bias is that not all similar problems can be solved in with the same method. Even for problems that can be solved using other solutions, these solutions may not be the best solution for the given problem. One can overcome this bias by surveying a wide variety of sources for solutions or looking for professional sources for finding solutions to one’s problems. </p>
