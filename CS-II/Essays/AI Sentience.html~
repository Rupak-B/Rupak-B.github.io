      <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
      <p>Sentient AI is Beneficial but it still has a variety of limitations in its current form.  DALL-E 2 is one of the AI that is at the forefront of this argument. Its capabilities in rendering with only a few keywords are outstanding. Its ability to strive away from simply compiling a series of images from Google and creating a human-like drawing is immaculate.  Robots also have practical applications such as Google’s AlphaFord, a system that has its roots in an algorithm that excelled at the board game Go, which was able to predict the structure of proteins in a three-dimensional field. This essentially solved the protein-folding problem which has confounded experienced biologists for decades. </p>
      <p>Although these algorithms can evaluate complex situations much more effectively than a human ever could, they are still far from possessing the capabilities of self-determination.  One example is Blake Lemoine and the word generating AI created by Google. Lemoine claimed that the algorithm had become sentient; however, professor of psychology Alison Gopnik sustains the stance that the algorithms of today are a far cry from becoming sentient. As Forbes describes, self-driving cars, the epitome of self-sustain technology, are still confined to what they excel at and the intelligence itself can not be altered. They must adapt to the state of the road at any moment in time, but they could still not react if an alien object were to hit the vehicle. The nature of not being able to change theThis key distinction prevents us from classifying robots as sentient. </p>
      <p>The limitations of current algorithms may not be felt even when asking an algorithm to create a unique or novel piece of work. AI analyses of certain departments can replicate sentences to varying extents. AI algorithms such as the ones used in TicTok and Youtube have become advanced enough to interpret what a human might enjoy based on only a few swipes. These algorithms can still be beneficial in a non-sentient state as they can achieve the goals and objectives we set for them. </p>
      <p>The overall goal of AI is to help humans in their current state and the future. If Sentient AI can do it more efficiently than our current systems then it shall be the future of algorithms. Despite this, the current systems still provide helpful resources to humans.</p>
