    <h1> My Computer Science 1 Portfolio </h1>
    <p>Last year in CS1 I learned a variety of skills in both Linux and Swift.<p>
    <p>I learned basic operation and how to manipulate variables as well as how to use opperands. I also learned a bit about computer history and prossesing systems and how to process information. The use and knowledge of value types such as String, Bool, Int, ect were instrumental in my programing then and also in the future. I also learned loops and the roles that they play in sorting based algorithms specifically with bubble sort. 
    I also learned a variety of skills involving loops and Igis which allowed me to build my ISP. I really enjoyed working in Igis and hope to learn more about it.</p>
    <p> I also learned how through collaboration and thinking I was able to achieve some of the difficult objectives such as "Making Change"
      and my ISP project. Overall I have learned a lot about Linux and Swift throughout my time and CS1 and I wish to learn so much more in CS2.</p>
